## **Project Title: Waze User Churn Prediction Model**

**Project Overview**

Waze, the popular navigation app, strives to enhance the driving experience for users worldwide. As part of Waze's ongoing commitment to improving user satisfaction, you will collaborate with a team to address the issue of user churn, which quantifies the number of users who uninstall or stop using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn prediction, aiming to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts when users are likely to churn.

**Task**

Data collection and preprocessing of user data.
Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
Developing a churn prediction model using machine learning.
Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Identifying specific factors contributing to churn and answering key questions:
Who are the users most likely to churn?
Why do users churn?
When do users churn?

**Tools and Libraries**

Jupyter Notebook,
Python,
numpy,
pandas,
matplotlib,
scikit-learn,
RandomForestClassifier,
XGBClassifier,
pickle

**Approach**

Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering.

Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into user behavior.

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model development, using both RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers.

Model evaluation, considering metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Fine-tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

Generating insights to optimize user retention strategies, enhance the user experience, and support data-driven decisions.

The successful implementation of a churn prediction model will empower Waze to proactively engage at-risk users and address specific churn factors. This project aligns with Waze's mission to continuously improve user satisfaction and drive growth by retaining users and enhancing their experience.
